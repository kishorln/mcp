# DynamoDB Data Model

## Design Philosophy & Approach

This design follows aggregate-oriented principles, consolidating frequently accessed data while separating historical records. The approach eliminates complex JOINs by denormalizing current employee status (salary, title, department) into the main Employee table, while maintaining separate tables for historical audit data. Analytics patterns use eventual consistency with GSIs optimized for cost.

## Aggregate Design Decisions

**Employee Aggregate**: Consolidates employee profile with current salary, title, and department information based on 60-70% access correlation. This eliminates the need for JOINs in the most common access patterns while keeping item size bounded (~500B per employee).

**Historical Data Separation**: Salary and title history maintained in separate tables due to low access correlation (15-20%) and unbounded growth patterns. These support audit requirements with per-employee access patterns.

**Reference Data Denormalization**: Department names embedded in employee records to eliminate lookup overhead for the most frequent patterns.

| 3 | Get current department | Employee | GetItem(emp_no, "PROFILE") | Department info embedded, no JOIN |
| 4 | Get current title | Employee | GetItem(emp_no, "PROFILE") | Current title embedded in profile |
| 5 | Employee with department | Employee | GetItem(emp_no, "PROFILE") | All data in single item, eliminates JOIN |
| 6 | Count by gender | EmployeesByGender GSI | Query(gender) + app aggregation | Eventual consistency acceptable |
| 7 | Count by department | EmployeesByDepartment GSI | Query(dept_no) + app aggregation | Eventual consistency acceptable |

## Hot Partition Analysis
- **Employee Table**: 70 RPS distributed across 300K employees = 0.0002 RPS per partition ✅
- **EmployeesByGender GSI**: 2 RPS across 2 partitions = 1 RPS per partition ✅
- **EmployeesByDepartment GSI**: 4 RPS across 9 partitions = 0.44 RPS per partition ✅
- **SalaryHistory**: 7 RPS distributed across 300K employees = 0.00002 RPS per partition ✅

## Trade-offs and Optimizations

- **Aggregate Design**: Consolidated Employee + current status based on 60-70% access correlation - trades item size (500B) for query performance and eliminates JOINs
- **Denormalization**: Duplicated department name in Employee table to avoid GSI lookup - trades 40B storage per employee for <50ms response time
- **Historical Data Separation**: Kept salary/title history separate due to low access correlation (15-20%) and unbounded growth - optimizes main table performance
- **GSI Projection**: Used INCLUDE projection for analytics GSIs to balance cost vs performance - projects only needed attributes
- **Identifying Relationships**: Used emp_no as partition key for history tables to eliminate GSI overhead - saves 50% on write costs
- **Analytics Strategy**: Application-level aggregation with eventual consistency - trades real-time accuracy for cost and performance
